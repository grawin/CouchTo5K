# CouchTo5K
Android app for "couch to 5k" exercise routine

## Goal
I came up with this project as an achievable project to do in my free time to get some experience with Android development. This was built using Google's Android Studio IDE.

## Description
Sofa to Sprint is an easy to use app for following the famous beginner's "Couch to 5K" running plan. It provides on screen prompts and sound/vibrate notifications for switching between walking and running. When starting a workout, the app runs in the background allowing users to navigate to other content, such as setting up their music or simply turning off the display.

### Features
* One of the only ad free "Couch to 5K" options
* Properly runs in background allowing for navigation to other apps or playing music
* Easy to read timer displays for current activity and overall workout
* Sound and vibrate notifications to prompt for changing between walking and running
* Lightweight and easy to use

### About “Couch to 5K”
The goal of the program is to get into shape to complete a 5K race. The program is broken out over nine weeks. Each week has three workout days to allow for resting in between. It starts off with many short intervals between walking and running (or jogging) and progresses to larger intervals, then mostly running. It would be best to research the "Couch to 5K" plan to get a better understanding before using this app. As with any exercise activity, know your limits, start out slow, and always warm up to avoid injury. It is common for new runners to repeat days or even weeks of the program before moving on. Stick with it!

### Getting started
Load up the app, select your desired starting point (defaults to Week 1 Day 1). Hit “Start” to start from a new activity, hit “Resume” to start where you left off. Click “Start” to begin the day's workout when you are ready and either watch the timers on a treadmill or listen to the audio/vibrate cues to switch between walking and running. It's as easy as that!

### Required Permissions
* Vibrate for vibrate notifications
